Save a debug note / solution to References/Notes/ for future reference.

Follow the SOP at References/SOP/UE_Automation_SOP.md Step 4.

Steps:
1. Use the issue description from $ARGUMENTS, or if empty, ask the user what problem was encountered
2. Gather:
   - What was the error/symptom?
   - What was the root cause?
   - What was the solution?
   - What can be learned to prevent recurrence?
3. Create a note file at: References/Notes/YYYY-MM-DD_<issue-brief>.md
   Use today's date and a brief descriptive name (Chinese or English)
4. Use the template from References/Notes/README.md
5. Update the index table in References/Notes/README.md (append a new row)
6. If the lesson is universal enough, propose an update to CLAUDE.md

Issue context: $ARGUMENTS
